## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Optimization of the portfolio project.

Images, html and css are minimized using grunt, creating a production version of the web inside the "dist" folder. Also, some styles have been inlined in the main page to get a faster initial response.

Pizza website has been optimized to get a smoother scrolling and resizing, by hiding unnecesary animated elements and reducing the amount of calculations in javascript.

There is a hosted version of the production site available in:

 http://pedromarce.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

Just open index.html from source folder for development version, index.html from dist folder for production version or go to the hosted URL to check the website.
